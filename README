SemantEco
=============
SemantEco provides a framework for integrating and presenting
environmental and ecological data in a web application. It uses
Semantic Web standard languages (RDF, OWL) to represent the graph
structure of scientific data and artificial intelligence algorithms to
reason about data. The framework also includes a number of
visualization options that allow users to find and plot data from
different domains based on location.

SemantEco provides a number of different data providers for different
domains including water, air, and various species.
